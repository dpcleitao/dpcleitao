Over the last ten years, Iâ€™ve worked specifically in the Product space, and I currently work as the Director of Product at Skoot in London. My journey into this space has been an exciting one, as I initially co-founded two businesses in the early stages of my career.

These endeavours gave me invaluable knowledge - not just about Product, but about people management, sales development and operational processes. Having an entrepreneurial mindset naturally progressed into working for varying start-ups, a world that has always intrigued me.

Start-ups arenâ€™t for everybody, but I feel like itâ€™s given me a different perspective and approach to a lot of my day to day professional life, whether itâ€™s managing teams or refining processes. The constant shifts and innovations excite me - I guess you could say that I love organised chaos?

With a blend of skill sets and experiences, Iâ€™ve also taken a great interest in consulting, and Iâ€™m always open to connecting with those looking for advice on strategy and people management.

Although Iâ€™ve lived and worked in London for the past five years, Iâ€™m originally from Connecticut where I lived most of my life. Iâ€™ve also enjoyed working and gaining experiences from all over the world, and have spent time in Dubai, Paris and Puerto Rico.

London has definitely become my home, and itâ€™s given me a lot of opportunities to explore my other interests such as AI and Machine Learning, and of course - Football. If youâ€™re a Liverpool or Celtic fan, we need to talk!
